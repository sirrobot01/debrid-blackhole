#### Config Notes
##### Debrid Config
- This config key is important as it's used for both Blackhole and Proxy

##### Proxy Config
- The `enabled` key is used to enable the proxy
- The `port` key is the port the proxy will listen on
- The `debug` key is used to enable debug logs
- The `username` and `password` keys are used for basic authentication
- The `cached_only` means only cached torrents will be returned


##### Qbittorrent Config
- The `port` key is the port the qBittorrent will listen on
- The `username` and `password` keys are used for basic authentication
- The `download_folder` is the folder where the torrents will be downloaded. e.g `/media/symlinks/`
- The `categories` key is used to filter out torrents based on the category. e.g `sonarr`, `radarr`

### Proxy

The proxy is useful in filtering out un-cached Real Debrid torrents. 
The proxy is a simple HTTP proxy that requires basic authentication. The proxy can be enabled by setting the `proxy.enabled` to `true` in the config file. 
The proxy listens on the port `8181` by default. The username and password can be set in the config file.

Setting Up Proxy in Arr

- Sonarr/Radarr
  - Settings -> General -> Use Proxy
  - Hostname: `localhost` # or the IP of the server
  - Port: `8181` # or the port set in the config file
  - Username: `username` # or the username set in the config file
  - Password: `password` # or the password set in the config file
  - Bypass Proxy for Local Addresses -> `No`

### Qbittorrent

The qBittorrent is a mock qBittorrent API that supports the Arrs(Sonarr, Radarr, etc).

Setting Up Qbittorrent in Arr

- Sonarr/Radarr
  - Settings -> Download Client -> Add Client -> qBittorrent
  - Host: `localhost` # or the IP of the server
  - Port: `8282` # or the port set in the config file/ docker-compose env
  - Username: `admin` # or the username set in the config file
