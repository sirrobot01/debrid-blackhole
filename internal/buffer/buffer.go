// Package buffer is a high-performance byte buffer with a bounded
// in-memory ring and a sparse disk-backing file.
//
// Conceptually: a sparse, addressable byte buffer where recent writes are
// held in RAM (fast re-reads, write coalescing) and older or evicted ones
// spill to disk. The buffer knows nothing about networks, downloaders,
// segments, or FUSE — it's pure storage. Callers wrap it with whatever
// policy they need.
//
// Architecture
//
//   - Fixed 1 MB blocks, internal constant. Aligns with SSD page granularity
//     and the natural unit of streaming HTTP/NNTP chunks.
//   - LRU-managed block cache bounded by Config.MemorySize. Hot blocks
//     stay; cold ones are evicted and flushed if dirty.
//   - Sparse disk file pre-truncated to Config.TotalSize (when known) so
//     WriteAt at any offset within the logical range is valid without
//     growing the file lazily.
//   - WriteAt returns as soon as the data is in RAM; a block's dirty bytes are
//     persisted to disk lazily — when the block is evicted to make room, and on
//     Sync/Close. There is no background flush worker: the flush runs under the
//     buffer's exclusive lock (see flushBlockLocked for why it must), so
//     evicting a still-dirty block briefly serializes against readers. For the
//     write-once streaming workload this is rare in practice — blocks are
//     usually clean (re-read, never rewritten) by the time they reach the LRU
//     tail.
//   - Discard releases bytes from RAM AND from disk via fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE)
//     on Linux. On tmpfs this directly returns RAM to the kernel.
//
// # Range tracker
//
// A rangeSet maintains the set of byte ranges that are present anywhere
// (RAM or disk). ReadAt consults this first: any byte in the requested
// range that's not present causes ErrNotPresent. This is a stricter contract
// than zero-fill semantics, and is what callers building caches on top
// actually want — they need to distinguish "data was never written" from
// "data was written as zero".
