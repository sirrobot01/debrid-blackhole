Decypharr supports direct NNTP streaming from Usenet providers - no additional download client required.

## How It Works

Decypharr connects directly to NNTP servers to:

1. Parse NZB files for segment information
2. Stream segments on-demand for playback
3. Download and assemble complete files

## Provider Configuration

### Add Provider

```json
{
  "usenet": {
    "providers": [
      {
        "host": "news.provider.com",
        "port": 563,
        "username": "your_username",
        "password": "your_password",
        "backbone": "Omicron",
        "ssl": true,
        "max_connections": 20,
        "priority": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Multiple Providers

Decypharr can use multiple providers with priority and failover:

```json
{
  "usenet": {
    "providers": [
      {
        "host": "primary.news.com",
        "port": 563,
        "username": "user1",
        "password": "pass1",
        "backbone": "UsenetExpress",
        "ssl": true,
        "max_connections": 20,
        "priority": 1
      },
      {
        "host": "backup.news.com",
        "port": 563,
        "username": "user2",
        "password": "pass2",
        "backbone": "Omicron",
        "ssl": true,
        "max_connections": 10,
        "priority": 2
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Lower `priority` = higher preference.

`backbone` is optional. Set it when two providers share the same article spool so Decypharr can skip same-backbone providers after `423/430 article not found` responses.

## Performance Tuning

### Connection Limits

```json
{
  "usenet": {
    "max_connections": 15,
    "processing_max_connections": 15
  }
}
```

- `max_connections`: Per-file streaming connection limit
- `processing_max_connections`: Per-file parsing and NZB download connection limit
- Provider `max_connections`: Per-provider limit

**Example:**

- Global: `15`
- Provider A: `20`
- Provider B: `10`

→ Up to 15 connections per file, split between providers based on priority

### Read-Ahead Buffer

```json
{
  "usenet": {
    "read_ahead": "16MB"
  }
}
```

Prefetch buffer for smoother playback. Higher = smoother but more memory.

### Connection Idle Timeout

```json
{
  "usenet": {
    "conn_idle_timeout": "5m"
  }
}
```

How long unused NNTP connections stay warm in the pool before being closed
(default: `5m`). Idle connections are kept healthy with periodic keepalive
pings and verified before reuse. Players read in bursts with quiet gaps in
between, so closing connections too early forces a TCP+TLS+AUTH reconnect
on every resume — visible as playback stutter. Lower this only if your
provider aggressively drops idle sessions.

### Processing Limits

```json
{
  "max_active_downloads": 5,
  "usenet": {"processing_timeout": "10m"}
}
```

- `max_active_downloads`: Shared active-download limit for torrents and NZBs
- `processing_timeout`: Mark as bad if processing exceeds this

### Availability Checking

```json
{
  "usenet": {
    "availability_sample_percent": 10,
    "import_availability_sample_percent": 1
  }
}
```

Use `availability_sample_percent` for repair checks and
`import_availability_sample_percent` for the availability gate when adding an NZB.

- `100`: Check all segments (slow but accurate)
- `10`: Check 10% (fast but may miss issues)
- `1`: Quick import check (default)

### Content Verification

The availability check only proves that the articles exist. After it passes,
decypharr also reads the head of each video file through the streaming stack
and checks for a valid media container signature. This catches NZBs whose
articles all exist but assemble into a broken stream (for example, RAR volumes
in the wrong order). If the check fails, the NZB is marked failed and the Arr
grabs a replacement release. The check reads one article per video file.

## Disk Buffer

```json
{
  "usenet": {
    "disk_buffer_path": "/cache/usenet/streams"
  }
}
```

Streams use disk buffer for assembly. Ensure sufficient disk space.

## Repair

```json
{
  "usenet": {
    "skip_repair": false
  }
}
```

## Arr Integration

Arrs send NZB files to Decypharr via the Sabnzbd API endpoint:

See [Sabnzbd Integration](./sabnzbd/) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failures

- Verify host/port/SSL settings
- Test manually: `telnet news.provider.com 563`
- Check provider status

### Slow Streaming

1. Increase `max_connections` per provider
2. Increase global `max_connections`
3. Increase `read_ahead` buffer

### Processing Timeouts

- Increase `processing_timeout` for large files
- Reduce `availability_sample_percent` for faster checks
- Increase `max_active_downloads` if the system and providers have capacity

### Incomplete Downloads

- Enable `skip_repair: false` for PAR2 repair
- Check provider retention (old files may be incomplete)
- Try backup provider if available
