## Installation Issues

### Docker container won't start

**Check logs:**

```bash
docker logs decypharr
```

**Common causes:**

- Port 8282 already in use
- Invalid volume paths
- Permission issues on mounted directories

**Fix:**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  decypharr:
    ports:
      - "8283:8282"  # Use different external port
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    user: "1000:1000"  # Match your user ID
```

### Binary: "permission denied"

Make executable:

```bash
chmod +x decypharr
./decypharr
```

### "unsupported version" on startup

Decypharr stops with a message like this, and the container restarts in a loop:

```
failed to create item stores: failed to create entries store: unsupported version: 4 (max: 3)
```

The database in your data directory uses a newer format than the running version can read. This happens when you
move to a newer Decypharr tag and then go back. The newer build upgrades the database on first start, and older
builds refuse the new format.

**Upgrade Decypharr again.** A newer version reads every format. This is the quickest fix and it keeps all your
data.

### Go back to an older version

Run the newer Decypharr once, then use its `downgrade-db` command. It rewrites the databases in the format the older
release reads, and it carries everything you have done since the upgrade:

```bash
docker compose stop decypharr
docker compose run --rm decypharr /decypharr downgrade-db
```

Then start the older release. Use `-to 4` instead if you are going back to a build that reads format 4.

The command keeps the current databases as `.pre-downgrade.bak`, so the downgrade is itself reversible. It converts
every database before it replaces any: if one holds something the older format cannot express, it stops and changes
nothing. Decypharr must be stopped, because each database is locked by the process that has it open.

You can move between versions as often as you need. On a later run, add `-replace-backup` to overwrite the
`.pre-downgrade.bak` files an earlier run left behind.

### Restore a pre-upgrade copy

A newer build also saves a copy of each database before it upgrades it. Restoring one returns your data to the
moment of the upgrade, so anything done since is lost. Prefer `downgrade-db`. Stop Decypharr, then:

```bash
cd /path/to/data/db
for backup in *.v3.bak; do
  mv "$backup" "${backup%.v3.bak}"
done
```

Builds released before this safeguard do not save a copy. If there is no `.bak` file and `downgrade-db` is not
available, delete the `db` directory. Decypharr rebuilds the library from your debrid providers on the next start,
but the download queue and repair history are lost.

Backup files are never deleted automatically. Remove them once you no longer plan to go back.

## Authentication Issues

### API token not working

1. Regenerate token:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer OLD_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:8282/api/refresh-token
   ```
2. Check token in `/config/config.json` (`api_token` field)
3. Ensure Authorization header format: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

## Mount Issues

### Mount point empty

**Check mount status:**

```bash
ls -la /mnt/decypharr
mount | grep decypharr
```

**Common causes:**

- FUSE not available
- Permission issues
- Mount path doesn't exist

**Fix (Docker):**

```yaml
services:
  decypharr:
    devices:
      - /dev/fuse
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    security_opt:
      - apparmor:unconfined
```

**Fix (Binary):**

```bash
# Install FUSE
sudo apt install fuse  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install fuse  # CentOS/RedHat

# Add user to fuse group
sudo usermod -a -G fuse $USER
```

### "Transport endpoint is not connected"

Mount crashed. Unmount and restart:

```bash
# Force unmount
sudo fusermount -u /mnt/decypharr
# or
sudo umount -l /mnt/decypharr

# Restart Decypharr
docker restart decypharr
```

### "Permission denied" accessing files

Set correct UID/GID:

```json
{
  "mount": {
    "dfs": {
      "uid": 1001,
      "gid": 1001
    }
  }
}
```

Find your user ID:

```bash
id your_username
```

## Debrid Provider Issues

### "API key invalid"

1. Verify key at provider dashboard
2. Check for typos/extra spaces
3. Regenerate API key
4. Update config and restart

### "No free slots"

**Check slots:**

- Real Debrid: https://real-debrid.com/torrents
- All Debrid: Dashboard

**Solutions:**

1. Remove old torrents manually
2. Configure slot management:
   ```json
   {
     "debrids": [
       {
         "minimum_free_slot": 10,
         "limit": 100
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
3. Add backup provider

### Rate limit errors

Reduce request rate:

```json
{
  "debrids": [
    {
      "rate_limit": "100/minute",
      "workers": 25
    }
  ]
}
```

Or add more API keys:

```json
{
  "download_api_keys": ["KEY1", "KEY2", "KEY3"]
}
```

### "Link unavailable" or "Download failed"

Links expire after `auto_expire_links_after` (default 24h). Repair worker should fix automatically.

**Manual fix:**

1. Go to Repair page
2. Click "Scan Now"
3. Process detected jobs

## Usenet Issues

### Connection failed to NNTP server

**Check connectivity:**

```bash
telnet news.provider.com 563
```

**Verify config:**

- Correct host/port
- Valid username/password
- SSL enabled if provider requires
- Provider account active

### NZB processing timeout

Increase timeout:

```json
{
  "usenet": {
    "processing_timeout": "20m",
    "import_availability_sample_percent": 1
  }
}
```

### Incomplete downloads

1. Enable repair:
   ```json
   {"repair": {"skip_nzb_repair": false}}
   ```
2. Check provider retention (old content may be incomplete)
3. Try different provider

### "Too many connections"

Provider limit exceeded. Reduce:

```json
{
  "usenet": {
    "max_connections": 10
  }
}
```

And per-provider:

```json
{
  "usenet": {
    "providers": [
      {"max_connections": 15}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Arr Integration Issues

### Test connection fails

1. **Check accessibility:**
   ```bash
   curl http://decypharr:8282/version
   ```
2. **Verify credentials in Arr match config**
3. **Check firewall rules**
4. **Try IP instead of hostname**

### Downloads stuck "Queued" in Arr

1. Check Decypharr logs for errors
2. Verify Debrid provider has free slots
3. Check `download_uncached` setting in Arr config
4. Manually test adding torrent via Decypharr UI

### Files not importing

**Path mapping issue:**

Arr and Decypharr must see files at identical paths:

```yaml
# Both services
volumes:
  - /mnt/media:/mnt/media
```

**Check download action:**

```json
{
  "arrs": [
    {
      "name": "Sonarr",
      "download_action": "symlink"  # For mounts
    }
  ]
}
```

### Torrent shows completed but Arr shows downloading

Arr sync delay. Wait 1-2 minutes or trigger manual import in Arr.

## Performance Issues

### High CPU usage

**Check:**

```bash
docker stats decypharr
```

**Causes:**

- Too many concurrent workers
- Repair loop
- Usenet processing

**Solutions:**

1. Reduce workers:
   ```json
   {
     "debrids": [{"workers": 25}],
     "repair": {"workers": 1, "enabled": false}
   }
   ```
2. Temporarily disable repair
3. Check logs for errors/loops

### High memory usage

**Usenet streams use disk buffer**. Check:

```json
{
  "usenet": {
    "disk_buffer_path": "/cache/usenet"
  }
}
```

Ensure sufficient disk space.

For Rclone:

```json
{
  "mount": {
    "rclone": {
      "vfs_cache_max_size": "5GB"
    }
  }
}
```

### Slow streaming/buffering

**DFS:**

```json
{
  "mount": {
    "dfs": {
      "chunk_size": "20MB",
      "disk_cache_size": "100GB"
    }
  }
}
```

**Usenet:**

```json
{
  "usenet": {
    "read_ahead": "32MB",
    "max_connections": 20
  }
}
```

**Check provider performance:**

- Test speed from Debrid website
- Try different Usenet provider
- Check network bandwidth

### Database growing large

Config stored in `config.json` (text). No separate database.

If logs are large:

```json
{"log_level": "warn"}
```

## WebDAV Issues

### Can't connect to WebDAV

1. **Test URL:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8282/webdav/
   ```
2. **Check auth:**
   ```json
   {
     "use_auth": true,
     "enable_webdav_auth": true
   }
   ```
3. **Verify credentials match config**

### Authentication keeps prompting

Clear browser cache or saved credentials.

For apps, provide full URL with auth:

```
http://username:password@decypharr:8282/webdav/
```

### Files won't play in WebDAV client

WebDAV has no local cache - streaming depends on Debrid/Usenet speed. For better performance, use DFS mount instead of
WebDAV.

## Repair Worker Issues

### Repair jobs stuck "Processing"

1. **Raise workers:**
   ```json
   {"repair": {"workers": 10}}
   ```
2. **Check provider rate limits** (probes may be throttled by `repair_rate_limit` or `nntp_connection_percent`).
3. **Restart Decypharr:**
   ```bash
   docker restart decypharr
   ```

### False positives in repair

Lengthen `recheck_interval` so brief outages don't flap entries through `broken`, and turn off `auto_repair` to review brokens before they're acted on:

```json
{
  "repair": {
    "recheck_interval": "336h",
    "auto_repair": false
  }
}
```

Brokens then sit in the Browse UI with their reason; you can fire **Recheck health** on individual entries. Fixes should be triggered through the Arr integration.

### Repair not detecting issues

1. **Verify repair enabled and scheduled:**
   ```json
   {"repair": {"enabled": true, "schedule": "0 4 * * *"}}
   ```
2. **Check per-Arr skip:**
   ```json
   {
     "arrs": [
       {"skip_repair": false}
     ]
   }
   ```
3. **Trigger a sweep now:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:8282/api/repair/run
   ```
4. **Force-recheck a specific entry:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
     'http://localhost:8282/api/repair/health/My.Show.S01/check'
   ```

## Debugging

### Enable debug logging

```json
{"log_level": "debug"}
```

**Docker:**

```bash
docker logs -f decypharr
```

**Binary:**

```bash
./decypharr 2>&1 | tee decypharr.log
```

### Check configuration

**View current config:**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8282/api/config | jq
```

**Validate JSON:**

```bash
cat /config/config.json | jq
```

### Health check

```bash
# Version
curl http://localhost:8282/version

# Torrents (requires auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8282/api/torrents
```

### Reset to defaults

**Backup current config:**

```bash
cp /config/config.json /config/config.json.backup
```

**Delete config:**

```bash
rm /config/config.json
```

**Restart - setup wizard will run**
